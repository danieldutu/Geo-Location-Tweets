# Geo-Location-Tweets (German)

## Kaggle competition I've participated with my solution.
This is a text geo-location challenge in which competitors train regression models on a data set containing German tweets. Competitors are scored based on the mean absolute error on a given test set. For each tweet, the participants have to predict its geographic location in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates.
